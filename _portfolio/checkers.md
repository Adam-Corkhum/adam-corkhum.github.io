A simple Checkers game created in C++ using SFML to render and display game state. This project was completed as a requirement in the Computing IV Course. The board is stored as a 2d array that holds characters representing each piece and its location. The game logic will tell the player when its their turn, allowing them to highlight one of their pieces and move it to an available space. The game keeps track of how many pieces are left for both players, and when one player has no more pieces or valid moves, they lose.
