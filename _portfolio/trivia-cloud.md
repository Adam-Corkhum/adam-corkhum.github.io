 [Trivia Cloud](https://github.com/cjcocokrisp/trivia-cloud "Github page") is a  web-based real time trivia game created using Amazon Web Services. It offers real time gameplay similar to Kahoot, where one user can create a lobby, set the category and number of questions, and other users can join their lobby.
 
 
  It used the Open Trivia Database for questions to allow for different questions based on a variety of categories. Game flow is simple, players will join a lobby and then answer questions and then after answering they will be told if they are right or wrong. Unlike other games like this, the scores of the others will not be revealed until the end of the game to leave you in the dark about how the people you are playing against are doing. Built for the Fall 2024 COMP.4600 Selected Topics: Cloud Computing final project.
