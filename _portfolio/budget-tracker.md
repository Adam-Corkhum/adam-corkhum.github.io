Budget Tracker is an android app that helps the user keep track of their purchases. The main intention behind its creation is to be an ad-free, locally stored app which prevents companies from selling your data online and sending you targeted ads. The user can enter the title, amount spent, category and date, which is stored locally in a database. The application will keep track of how much is spent in any current month, and alert the user when they're above their spending limit. It offers data visualization using pie and bar charts.
