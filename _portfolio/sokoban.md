Sokoban is a classic puzzle game in which the player controls a character to push crates onto designated storage locations. This game was created using SFML and C++ in order to translate a set of characters in a text file into the board game, rendering each one as an image. The game has built-in collision detection, keyboard input handling, animation and multiple levels.
